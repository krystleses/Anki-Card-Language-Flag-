I find it useful to add a flag to my Anki cards when I'm studying two similar romance languages. 

First, download a flag.
Second, store that file in your Anki Collection folder. This changed recently, I'll defer to Anki's documentation for the exact location: 
https://docs.ankiweb.net/files.html#file-locations
Third, update your Deck's Card Templates, Front and Back, with the code "<img src = "INSERT FILE NAME" width=40 align=left>"
